MemMgr - high-performance slabbed memory management in C
========================================================

Memory Manager is a high-performance memory allocation library
developed by NetGovern (aka Netmail, aka Messaging Architects).
It was created to increase performance in programs which request
and free memory at such high volumes that OS-level malloc/calloc
calls become a bottleneck.

MemMgr also has features which are helpful in hunting down
memory-related bugs such as leaks and buffer overruns.
