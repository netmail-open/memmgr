<h1>About</h1>
<p>
MemMgr - high-performance slabbed memory management in C
</p>
<p>
  Memory Manager is a high-performance memory allocation library
  developed by NetGovern (aka Netmail, aka Messaging Architects).
  It was created to increase performance in programs which request
  and free memory at such high volumes that OS-level malloc/calloc
  calls become a bottleneck.
</p>
<p>
  MemMgr ("MM" if one is in a rush!) makes use of, and includes,
  XPL.  XPL is a cross-platform library which abstracts various OS
  functions and dates back to when Netmail was NIMS and ran on,
  among other things, Novell Netware.  There is naturally a certain
  amount of historical memorabilia here.  XPL might (and perhaps should)
  be split off into a separate project as an optional dependency for
  memmgr.
</p>
<p>
  MemMgr has two main modes of operation:
<ul>
<li>
  Slabber - Memory is allocated in page-aligned, speed- and
  memory-optimized slabs.  Repeated calls to MemMalloc() etc are much
  faster than allocating directly.
</li>
<li>
  Guard - Memory is not speed-optimized.  Each created buffer is
  padded on either end with bytes which are easy to spot in a debugger,
  to help hunt down and fix tricky bugs.  It is no substitute for
  <a href="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</a>, but is much faster
  both in setup time (change a #define) and in execution.  MemMgr can
  also work side-by-side with valgrind, and take measures to prevent its
  own assertions from triggering valgrind's invalid-read checks, etc.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of operating mode, MemMgr can detect and report memory leaks,
  and this reporting can be customized so that various consumers can
  specify "owners" of given allocations.
