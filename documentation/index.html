  <!--
- if have tons of certain-size allocs
  - better to increase slab size, have 3 huge slabs than 27 smaller slabs (100k allocs etc)
    - why?  rodney could figure out 
    - lots of slabs maybe searches more ? 

future feature, req kernel mod?:  
  - buf overrun hard to track down
    - bad guy fled crime scene, future victim trips over and blows up
    - in netware, auto double allocation, blank pages between
      - cross boundary = page fault  (big ol' redzone detected in hardware)  
- origin pre-thane - preallocate to keep mrb alive during traffic storms

<h1>About</h1>
<p>
MemMgr - high-performance slabbed memory management in C
</p>
<p>
  Memory Manager is a high-performance memory allocation library
  developed by NetGovern (aka Netmail, aka Messaging Architects).
  It was created to:
  <ul>
	<li><strong>increase performance</strong> in programs which request
	  and free memory at such high volumes that OS-level malloc/calloc
	  calls become a bottleneck.
	</li>
	<li><strong>solve fragmentation</strong> which results from mixed-size
	  allocations and frees.
	</li>
	<li><strong>evaluate and tune</strong> memory usage to handle peak
	  loads, both increasing speed and reducing memory requirements.
	</li>
	<li><strong>help with debugging</strong> common memory bugs including
	  leaks, double-frees, and buffer overruns.
  </ul>
</p>
  <p>
	When a process is very busy, allocating memory traditionally becomes slower.
	When memory allocation becomes slower, a busy process only gets busier.
	MemMgr can break this vicious cycle!  By
	using MemMgr's reporting (live usage statistics can be dumped at will, for
	instance during a service's peak usage) developers can learn the real-world
	memory requirements of a process, and then tune it to preallocate pools
	accordingly.
  </p>
<p>
  MemMgr has two main modes of operation:
<ul>
<li>
  Slabber - Memory is allocated in slabs, optimized for running.
  Repeated calls to MemMalloc() etc are much faster than allocating directly.
</li>
<li>
  Guard - Memory usage is geared for debugging.  Each created buffer is
  padded on either end with bytes which are easy to spot in a debugger,
  to help hunt down and fix tricky bugs.  It is no substitute for
  <a href="http://valgrind.org">valgrind</a>, but is much faster
  both in setup time (change a #define) and in execution.  MemMgr can
  also work side-by-side with valgrind, and take measures to prevent its
  own assertions from triggering valgrind's invalid-read checks, etc.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of operating mode, MemMgr can detect and report memory leaks,
  and this reporting can be customized so that various consumers can
  specify "owners" of given allocations.
</p>
  <p>
	Memory pools may be used to recycle resources.
	For example, a pool of connection structures,
	each with its own library handles, locks, etc, can be pre-initialized, then
	consumer code can grab and return these structures from and to the pool,
	without needing to initialize every instance every time.
  </p>
  <h1>(Built-in) Dependencies</h1>
  <p>
	MemMgr ("MM" if one is in a rush!) makes use of, and includes,
	XPL.  XPL is a cross-platform library which abstracts various OS
	functions and dates back to when Netmail was NIMS and ran on,
	among other things, Novell Netware.  There is naturally a certain
	amount of historical memorabilia here.
  </p>
  <p>
	XPL might (and perhaps should)
	be split off into a separate project as an optional dependency for
	memmgr.  XPL's threading library could be similarly split out.
  </p>
