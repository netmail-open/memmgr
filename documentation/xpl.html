<h1>MemMgr Synopsis</h1>

<p>
  The main memmgr interfaces mimic standard library (and string) functions,
  but underneath the memory is being allocated in optimized (and, where
  possible, page-aligned) slabs.  The consumer can leave these details up
  to memmgr, optimize further by using allocation size hints, or fine-tune
  further still by specifying pages per slab, number and size of nodes, and
  other implementation details.
</p>
<p>
  MemMgr is thread-safe, though the threads it is designed around are
  <a href="xpl.html">XPL</a> threads, for historical reasons.  Decoupling
  this would take some work, but is certainly possible.
